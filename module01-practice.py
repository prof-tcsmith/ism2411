Practice Questions for Module 1: Introduction to Python and Fundamentals of Variables

Below are 5 practice questions to help you exercise the concepts covered in this lecture.
Follow the instructions in each question and write your own code to solve them.
"""

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Practice Question 1:
# Define one variable for each of the following data types using snake_case naming:
# - Integer (e.g., units_sold)
# - Float (e.g., price_per_unit)
# - String (e.g., product_name)
# - Boolean (e.g., in_stock)
#
# Write your code below:
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# Your code goes here

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Practice Question 2:
# Using the variables defined in Question 1, print a message using an f-string
# that incorporates these variables.
#
# For example, the message might be:
# "The product UltraWidget sold 150 units at a price of 29.99 each. In stock: True"
#
# Write your code below:
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# Your code goes here

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Practice Question 3:
# Write code to print a message that combines text and variables using string concatenation.
# Additionally, experiment with the 'sep' and 'end' parameters of the print() function 
# to modify the output.
#
# Write your code below:
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# Your code goes here

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Practice Question 4:
# Write a code snippet that multiplies two numbers and assigns the result to a variable called total.
# Then, print the total with an appropriate message.
# Ensure your code is well-commented to explain each step.
#
# Write your code below:
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# Your code goes here

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Practice Question 5:
# The following variable names are invalid. Uncomment the lines and correct them to follow
# Python's naming rules and the snake_case convention.
#
# Invalid examples:
# 1. 1st_number = 100
# 2. product-name = "Widget"
# 3. total sales = 200
#
# Write your corrected code below:
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# Corrected variable names (sample corrections):
# first_number = 100
# product_name = "Widget"
# total_sales = 200
